# Advanced-Housing-Price-Prediction

Welcome to the Housing Price Prediction project, a robust machine learning pipeline designed to tackle the complexities of the Ames Housing Dataset from Kaggle. This dataset, a benchmark in advanced regression techniques, includes 79 features spanning architectural, spatial, and economic determinants of home prices of over 1500 houses.

*This project:*

- Implements a comprehensive data processing pipeline for cleaning, feature engineering, feature selection, training and model evaluation.

- Evaluates 7 machine learning models (LASSO, ElasticNet, SVM, Neural Networks, XGBoost, Random Forest) to predict sale prices with high accuracy.

- Delivers actionable insights for home buyers, investors, and real estate professionals by identifying key pricing drivers.

- Built in R using caret, tidyverse, and ggplot2, this framework balances interpretability and predictive power.
